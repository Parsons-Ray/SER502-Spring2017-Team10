Meeting 2(April 20)
Ximing Feng:
    Reviewed the phase-one code wrote by Rundong.
    Start working on phase-two.
    (Still have 2 days delay[4 hours], until April 22).
Xiangyu Guo:
    Explain what's the expectation of symbol table to Katie.
    Explain how to implement a syntax analysis to Ximing.
    Explain how to implement a semantics analysis to Rundong.
    Reviewed the phase-one code wrote by Katie, Ximing and Rundong.
    Reviewed the phase-one code wrote by Katie.
    Finishe working on phase-two (basic data structures and simple runtime environment)
    (The code is under review and needs more modifications before merge.)
Rundong Zhu:
    Reviewed the phase-one code wrote by Ximing.
    Continue working on phase-two.
    (Still have 1.5 days delay[3 hours], until April 22).
Katie MacArthur:
    Reviewed the phase-one code wrote by Xiangyu.
    Finished working on phase-two (symbol table).
    (The code is under review and needs more modifications before merge.)

Week 3: (April 23-29)
Meeting 1(April 25)
Ximing Feng:
    No review activity in these days.
    Complete working on phase-two, writing test cases for `generate_decl_stmt`, `generate_print_stmt`, `generate_assign_stmt`, `generate_stmt_list`.
    Start working on phase-three. Coding on `generate_expr_stmt`
    (Originally, he has 4 days delay[8 hours], until April 25).
    (Reschedule the development plan, half day[1 hour] delay so far).
Xiangyu Guo:
    Reviewed the phase-two code wrote by Katie, Ximing and Rundong.
    Helping Ximing catch up some delays, implement `generate_decl_stmt`, `generate_print_stmt`, `generate_assign_stmt`, `generate_stmt_list` in syntax analysis.
    Helping Rundong catch up some delays, implement `handle_decl_stmt` and refactor the code in semantic analysis.
    Explain how to implement `handle_expr` in semantic analysis to Rundong.
    Finished working on phase-three (fully functional runtime environment)
Rundong Zhu:
    Reviewed the phase-two code wrote by Xiangyu.
    Complete working on phase-two. `handle_print_stmt`, `handle_assign_stmt`.
    Complete working on phase-three. `handle_expr_stmt`.
    (Originally, he has 2 days delay[4 hours], until April 25).
    (Reschedule the development plan, no delay so far).
Katie MacArthur:
    Reviewed the phase-two code wrote by Xiangyu.
    Still working on phase-three, lexical analysis.
    (She didn’t publish her branch, so I can’t evaluate her progress accurately, right now she has 1 day delay[2 hours] on phase-three).
